The following are branches which each person will work in.
--Israel's Branch
--Saurabh's Branch
--Aakash's Branch
--Cliford's Branch

When you guys sync, make SURE you sync it to your own branch with your name and NOT THE MASTER Branch.
Once finished, and if all code is running fairly, all branches will be merged into the MASTER branch.

*** Please don't sync to the master branch because I'm getting errors again -.- :Saurabh***

The GARBAGE CODE Branch is for unrelated code and un-tested code.
